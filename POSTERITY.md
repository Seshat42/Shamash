# POSTERITY Notes

These notes explain why we follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md`.

- **Consistency** ensures that new contributors can easily navigate the
  project. Using standard Python style and clear documentation keeps the
  codebase approachable.
- **Documentation** across README and change logs helps track the
  project history and design decisions over time.
- **Testing** before committing avoids pushing broken code and maintains
  reliability.

Adhering to these practices supports long-term maintainability and
scalability of the Shamash project.
