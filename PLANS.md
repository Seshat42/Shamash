# Plan

1. Clarify the project positioning in `README.md`, removing the incomplete disclaimer and outlining production deployment expectations.
2. Expand `docs/README.md` with authoritative deployment, security, and release guidance, cross-referencing `SECURITY.md` and packaging assets.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` to record the documentation refresh and ensure references such as `docs/architecture.md` remain valid.
4. Regenerate supporting artifacts (`STATE.md`, `PATCHES.md`, `VERIFICATIONS.md`) to capture the documentation updates and executed checks.
