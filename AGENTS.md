# AGENTS Guidelines

This repository contains the Shamash media server and client.
Follow these guidelines when contributing:

- **Python Style**: Use 4 spaces for indentation and include module
docstrings and inline comments where helpful.
- **Directories**:
  - `server/` contains server-side code.
  - `client/` contains client-side code.
  - `docs/` holds documentation.
- **Documentation**: Keep `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `POSTERITY.md`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` up to date with your changes.
- **Commits**: Commit logical units of work. Update the changelog with a
  brief summary of each change.
- **Testing**: Run any available tests before committing. If no tests exist,
  ensure scripts execute without errors.

For the reasoning behind these conventions see `POSTERITY.md`.
